# Invoice System 

Welcome to **Invoice System**, a powerful and user-friendly console-based billing application built in **C++**. This project simulates a real-world supermarket billing system, allowing you to add inventory items, generate detailed invoices, and track sales—all through an intuitive console interface.  

---

##  Elevator Pitch
Transform your billing process into a fast, reliable, and professional system. No spreadsheets, no manual calculations—just enter items, quantities, and watch the invoice generate instantly with accurate totals and date-time stamping.

##  About This Project
The inspiration behind this project came from the need for a **simple yet efficient billing solution** for small shops and supermarkets. I wanted to create a system that is **lightweight, easy to use, and professional-looking**, even without a GUI.  

I focused on enhancing the **console interface** using Windows API features like `Sleep()` for smooth transitions and colors for better readability. Every invoice is saved to a separate file with a timestamp, making it easy to maintain records.

##  Features
- Add, edit, and maintain inventory items.
- Generate professional bills with proper formatting.
- Persistent storage of items using file handling.
- Unique invoice generation with date & time.
- Visual enhancements in console with colors and spacing.
- Easy to understand, fast, and reliable.

##  What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
- **C++ programming** (classes, objects, file handling)
- **Console UI design** (Windows API for colors and smooth transitions)
- **Problem solving** (calculating totals, stock management)
- **Time & date handling** using `<ctime>` for invoice timestamping

##  Built With
`C++`, `fstream`, `iostream`, `sstream`, `iomanip`, `Windows API`, `console interface`, `file handling`  

---

##  Achievements
- Fully functional **supermarket billing system** in C++.
- **Professional console UI** with colors and spacing.
- **Accurate invoice generation** with unique filenames and timestamps.  

---

##  Next Steps
- Upgrade to a **GUI version** using Qt or C++ GUI libraries.
- Add **search and filter** for inventory items.
- Implement **discounts, taxes, and reports** for more advanced billing.
